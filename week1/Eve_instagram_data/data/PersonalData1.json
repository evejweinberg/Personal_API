It‚Äôs an eclectic, multifaceted, plural and versatile way of thinking.\nFor their new on-air identity they were looking for something to convey a big change in their positioning, to stand out among the other SKY channels, something clear, brave and cool.\nWe came out with a strong typographic approach to celebrate their background, enclosed in a never-seen-on-TV design.\nProudly branded by NERDO.\n- CREDITS\nArt direction, animation: Alessandro Durando, Daniele Gavatorta, Lorenzo Levrero\nAdditional animator: Riccardo Chiara\nHead of Content and Communication: Riccardo Chiattelli\nBrand Manager: Fabio Pietranera\nOriginal Music (Graphick pack): Smider\nSound Design (Graphick pack): Andrea Pestarino\n¬© EFFE TV S.r.l."
